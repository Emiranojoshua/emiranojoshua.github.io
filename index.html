            What is HTML?
         </h3>
         <p>
            Javascript is <span>dynamic,</span> <span>intepreted</span> </span>and <span>weekly</span> typed programming language
            which was built with the purpose of running in host environment (e.g.
            inside of a webpage in the browser).
         </p>
         <p>It's part of pretty much any page you visit in the web as it's the only
            "thing" in web development that allows you ("the developer") to change 
            something on the page at runtime. Basically every time something opens, 
            closes, moves or chnges on a webpage, Javascript will be involved.
         </p>
         <p>
            There is also a lot of webpages which are almost entirely powered by 
            Javascript (i.e. where a lot of the rendering work happens in the browser),
            those pages typically use frameworks like Angular, but that a topic we'll 
            cover later in this course)
         </p>

         <h3>
            What will you learn in this Course?

            knowledge is required.

            apatters all the way to expert concepts and topics.
